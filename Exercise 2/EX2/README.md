# Operating Systems Project

## Exercise 2

This exercise has both a CircuitRouter-ParSolver and a CircuitRouter-SeqSolver folders

### Version 1.0
- Global mutexes implemented
- Program is working but has no noticeable speedup

### Version 2.0
- One mutex per grid coordinate has been implemented
- Program is working and a good speedup has been achieved

## Motivation
This project is a program that routes paths in a given circuitry
